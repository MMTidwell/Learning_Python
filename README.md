These are the very first programs that I built. I thought myself from home using Learn Python the Hard way, TreeHouse, and Udacity. The area of most concentration was Python, however I did dabble in HTML, CSS, and MySQL. There are a couple of small games that I built while learning that you should check out. My personal favorites are Ruins Game and pick_your_door, they are both located in the Learn Python the Hard Way folder.
