Binary - 1 - On
         0 - Off
    - Binary reads from right to left
    - Exponent    - Number    - Place Name
        2^0          1             Ones
        2^1          2             Twos
        2^2          4             Fours
        2^3          8             Eights
        2^4          16            Sixteens
        2^5          32            Thirty-twos

Bit - Smallest unit of binary (can be 0 or 1)
    - Positional number systems

Byte - 8 bits put together (ex. 01010101)

Decimal System - Positional number systems
    - Decimal reads from right to left
    - Exponent    - Number    - Place Name
        10^0          1             Ones
        10^1          10            Tens
        10^2          100           Hundreds
        10^3          1000          Thousands
        10^4          10000         Ten Thousands
        10^5          100000        Hundred Thousands

Hardware - Anything that is hard. In order for hardware to do anything they must have programs that have binary.
    Operating Sys - Helps all other comp programs to run well, controls the comp hardware
    Types of Data -
        RAM and Virtual Memory - store temp data
        ROM and Hard Drive - perm storage data

Software - is a collection of code/programs that run on the comp. They are considered soft since they can be
    changed at any time.
    Types of Software -
        Application - apps like chrome, facebook, word ....
            Programming Software - editors, debuggers, compilers and linkers (makes programs executable). These can
                be combined to make an IDE
        System - Designed to operate and control the comp hardware and give a platform. Runs in the background.

Language -
    Lower(Machine) level language - is the lowest language because it works with the hardware w/o using a compiler or
        interpreter. Different comp use different language
    High level language - Python, Java ....
    Compiling - turning a high level language into a low level language that hardwear can understand. This will take
        the info and turned into binary

Programming Languages and what they do -
    Client Server Model - client makes a request it goes to the server then the server sends it back to the client
    Front end - gets (styling of web page)
        HTML - Markup lang that build the structure of the website
        CSS - Styling lang that tells the browser how to look
        Java Script
    Back end - returns (info like name, points...) server side lang
        Mobile- Android = Java
            - IOS = Swift or Objective c
        Web - Ruby, Python, Java, PHP

Paradigm - is a way of doing something so a programming paradigm is a way of programming. A few of the common
    programming paradigms are procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming.
    Procedural - shows step by step to solve a problem
        programs - C
    Functional - more like math, using input info to give output
        programs - Racket
    OOP - uses code objects to mirror real world. Made up of attributes (represents the data associated with the
        object like a name, color, size) and methods (actions preformed with the object eat, sleep, walk).
        programs - Java, JavaScript, Objective C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift
